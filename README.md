# Python-Course-Project
Hello, I'm Lamine.
My project is a number analyzer. 
Upon opening the program, it will ask you to enter a number. This will repeat for 20 instances.
During these 20 instances, each number is appended to a list, added to a total and the list is sorted in ascending order.
After 20 numbers are entered, the program prints all the numbers in a list form. 
The program then prints 4 different features analyzed from the list.
It shows the lowest number, the highest number, the total and the average of all the numbers within the list.
The program then asksif you'd like to enter a new list. If you enter "y", the program loops back to the beginning and you enter 20 numbers again.
If you enter "n", the program ends the loop and prints the message "Thank you and goodbye!"
